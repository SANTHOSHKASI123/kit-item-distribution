Key Features
Item Allocation Optimization: Efficiently allocates items to kits based on demand and inventory levels.
Inventory Management: Provides insights on current stock levels and helps track inventory changes after each distribution.
Demand Analysis: Analyzes demand patterns to predict future needs and adjust kit distribution accordingly.
Data Visualization: Offers graphical representations of distribution metrics for easy interpretation.
Data Sources
The project utilizes data from:

Inventory management databases
Kit assembly records
Demand forecasting data (if available)
Tools and Technologies
Python: Core language for data processing and distribution logic.
Pandas and NumPy: For data handling and numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing item distribution and inventory levels.
SQL: For querying inventory databases.
Excel (optional): For exporting reports and insights in a shareable format.
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SANTHOSHKASI123/kit-item-distribution.git
cd kit-item-distribution
Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
